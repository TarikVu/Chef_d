# Chef_d

## Description
Originally developed for Senior Capstone Design I & II at the School of Computing at the University of Utah,  Chef'd is a cooking application aimed to provide users with a means to discover, order, plan, and share recipes all in one place. The recipe's found on our application are either scraped from websites with a scraper publicly available on Github, or created by fellow users.
