Smooth gently with a rice paddle.\nLayer salmon, cream cheese, and avocado on the rice, and roll it up tightly. Slice with a sharp knife, and enjoy right away with soy sauce.\nNotes\nStoring leftovers: I do not recommend trying to keep leftovers, particularly if you are using raw fish. Even if you do cooked fish and vegetables, once the rice is hard and cold in the fridge, it won’t be as enjoyable to eat.\nFreezing: Not recommended.",

Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with the crisp sides on the outside.\nContinue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on medium low for the breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and adhere to the bread.\nOnce you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.",
